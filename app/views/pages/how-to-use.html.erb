    <h2>About the catalog</h2>

    <p>Arthub flanders is a catalog of records which describe cultural heritage
    objects preserved by the museums of the museum of Fine ARts and 
    Contemporary arts in Flanders. A record is a collection of structured
    information which describes various properties of the object such as the
    title, its creator, the date of inception, physical dimensions, provenance,
    exhibition history,...</p>

    <p>Records are created, edited and managed by knowledge specialists in the
    cultural heritage organsations. Records are kept in a collection 
    registration system which acts as a central knowledge base for the 
    organisation. These systems are connected to the Arthub Flanders platform
    and will frequently and automatically exchange up-to-date copies of curated 
    list of records with the platform.</p>

    <h2>Using the catalog</h2>

    <h3>Searching through the catalog</h3>

    <p>There are two main ways of search through the catalog. You can use the 
    searchbar to look for particular search words, or you can use the facets 
    in the left sidebar to drill down into the collection. Combining both 
    full text search and search facets allows you to launch fine-grained 
    search queries yielding relevant records.</p>

    <h4>The searchbar</h4>

    <p>The searchbar is available on the frontpage, and in the header of each 
    inner page of the platform. Just like Google, typing one or more search 
    terms will yield a list of records in which these words are present. The 
    results are ordered by a relevancy score. This score is calculated based on 
    how many times the term occurs in a record, and the linguistic context 
    in which it appears.</p>

    <p><%= image_tag "manual-screenshot-1.png", :alt => "the search bar" %>
    </p>

    <p>Searching for multiple search terms without quotes will yield a set of 
    records in which each term occurs at least once. Multiple terms enclosed by 
    double quotes will be treated as single search term.</p>

    <p><%= image_tag "manual-screenshot-2.png", :alt => "the search bar with
    quoted search" %>
    </p>

    <p>The search bar on the inner pages features a dropdown which limits full 
    text searching to specific fields such as 'title', 'creator' and 'object 
    number'. The full text search will by default look through all available 
    fields.</p>

    <h4>The search facets</h4>

    <p>The left sidebar of the catalog features a set of facets which enables 
    drilling down into the collection by combining terms which are defined in 
    closed vocabularies. Selecting a keyword, will initiate a search query for 
    the selected keyword in the associated record field associated with the 
    facet. Subsequent selections of keywords will keep reducing the result 
    set.</p>

    <p><%= image_tag "manual-screenshot-3.png", :alt => "The search 
    facets" %></p>

    <p>Each term in a facet, also refers to the number of records associated 
    with the term. The amount of records is tied to the search context; it 
    refers to the number of records yielded by the last performed search query,
    which are associated with that particular term.</p>

    <p><%= image_tag "manual-screenshot-4.png", :alt => "The search 
    facets, selection made" %></p>

    <h3>Overview pages</h3>

    <p>The overview pages display a list of results yielded when you launch a
    a search query, or when you are just browsing. Each result represents a 
    single record which is aggregated in the platform. A record describes the
    properties of a physical cultural heritage object (a painting, a statue, a
    tapestry, a drawing, a print,...) such as the title, creator, type of     
    object, provenance,... Using the pagination links at the top of the list, 
    or the pagination at the bottom, you can browse through the list.</p>

    <p><%= image_tag "manual-screenshot-5.png", :alt => "The search 
    results with pagination" %></p>

    <p>You can sort the results by relevance, creator, year or title, using 
    the 'sort by' dropdown. When you perform a search, each result will be
    assigned a relevance score. Sorting by relevance puts the results with the
    highest scores first.</p>

    <p>By default, a result page will yield 10 results. Using the 'per page'
    dropdown, you can retrieve up to 100 results per page.</p>

    <p><%= image_tag "manual-screenshot-6.png", :alt => "sorting filters" 
    %></p>

    <h3>Detail page</h3>

    <p>The detail page of a record displays a set of basic properties. The 
    values of some of these properties are links. When you click on them, you 
    will trigger a search for similar records who have the same value for that 
    property. Below the basic properties, you will find a box 'for 
    developers' which contains a set of links which are useful for people who 
    want to reuse the recorded information in their own (digital) 
    applications.</p>

    <h2>For museum workers</h2>

    <p>Museum workers are encouraged to reuse records in the Arthub Flanders 
    platform for their (digital) museal projects. How to reuse the the records 
    is covered in the next section. This section is limited to how to extract 
    records and communicate with a technical partner.</p>

    <p><em>Q: How do I compile a curated list of records?</em><p>

    <p>Our goal is to create a spreadsheet which contains a list of links. A 
    technical partner will use (or develop) software which will go through the 
    list, open each link, download the record and process the information 
    stored in the record.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open up a spreadsheet program (Excel, LibreOffice,...)</li>
        <li>Open a new, empty spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>Fill out 'link' in the first cell of the first column. This is the
        header of your list.</li>
        <li>Search the catalog for relevant records.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the detail page of a single record you would like to 
        add to your list.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to the 'For developers' box and right-click with on 
        the LIDO XML link.</li>
        <li>Select 'copy' from the pop-up menu.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the second cell in the first column.</li>
        <li>Select 'paste' from the pop-up menu.</li>
        <li>The link should be added to the spreadsheet document.</li>
        <li>Keep  selecting, copying and pasting links to compile an entire 
        list in the spreadsheet document.</li>
        <li>(optional) Add titles, creators,... in subsequent columns.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>Once you're ready, pass your list on to your technical partner. 
     Depending on the context, your partner will use that list to automatically 
     download and process the records in the (digital) application you 
     comissioned.</p>

    <p><em>Q: Can I add more records later on?</em><p>

    <p>Yes. This is possible. You just have to pass on additional sets of 
    links. Your technical partner might require you to pass on these lists as 
    additional spreadsheet documents. Or your digital application might be 
    equipped with a easy 'upload' functionality, automatically importing 
    additional sets of records.</p>

    <p><em>Q: What happens when I change a record?</em></p>

    <p>Your requirements may include that your digital application fetches an 
    updated version of the records in your list every so often (weekly, 
    monthly). Your application should handle how the updated information is 
    processed depending on what you are trying to achieve. In many cases, 
    updating means replacing the older version of the record with a newer 
    version.</p>

    <p>Beware though, if your business case requires you to actively edit the 
    records in your digital application, merging updates might become very 
    complex.</p>

    <p>Always discuss with your technical partner what you want to achieve and 
    what the (technical and financial) implications and drawbacks will be!</p>

    <h2>For developers</h2>

    <h3>JSON API</h3>

    <p>The Arthub Flanders platforms features a straightforward JSON API.</p>

    <p><strong>Search queries</strong></p>

    <p><code>/en/catalog.json?search_field=all_fields&q="James+Ensor"</code></p>

    <p>This will yield a JSON formatted response containing a list of results
    which is stored in the 'docs' property. The 'pages' property contains 
    extra information which allows automatic pagination and harvesting of 
    the API.</p>

    <pre><code>{
  "response": {
    "docs":[ ... ],
    "pages": {  
      "current_page":1,
      "next_page":2,
      "prev_page":null,
      "total_pages":7,
      "limit_value":10,
      "offset_value":0,
      "total_count":61,
      "first_page?":true,
      "last_page?":false
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p><strong>Single record</strong></p>

    <p>Switching between either the XML or JSON presentation of a record is 
    done by changing between the 'xml' and 'json' file extension in the URL.</p>

    <p><code>/en/catalog/kmska:2712_236.json</code>

    <pre><code>{
  "response": {
    "document":{
      "creator":["Arnó Stern"],
      "data_pid":"http://kmska.be/collection/work/data/2712_236",
      "creator_display":["Arno Stern"],
      "artwork_type_display":["tekening"],
      "period":"19de eeuw",
      "work_pid":"http://kmska.be/collection/work/id/2712_236",
      "object_number":"2712/236",
      "title_display":"De schilder James Ensor",
      "production_date":"0",
      "production_date_sort":"0",
      "repository":"KMSKA",
      "artwork_category":["Figuurvoorstellingen"],
      "creator_role":["tekenaar"],
      "id":"kmska:2712_236",
      "timestamp":"2017-11-22T17:26:55.018Z"
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p><code>/en/catalog/kmska:2712_236.xml</code>

    <p>The XML variant contains the full LIDO XML document as it is provided by 
    the contributing cultural organisation. The JSON presentation of the 
    document only contains the information extracted from the LIDO XML 
    document which is needed to present the record and make the record 
	findable in the Arthub Flanders search machine.</p>

	<h3>OAI-PMH</h3>

    <p>The Arthub Flanders offers an OAI-PMH endpoint for easy harvesting of 
    all available records via the Datahub. The endpoint provides the records 
    in LIDO XML format.</p>

    <p>The endpoint is available via this URL:</p>

    <p><a href="https://datahub.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/oai">
    https://datahub.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/oai</a></p>

    <p>More information can be found on the 
    <a href="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI-PMH website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p><em>Q: Do I see all the information recorded by the museums?</em></p>

    <p>The Arthub Flanders publishes a record with a curated set of the basic 
    properties which are registered by the museums. The museums record many 
    different aspects of a cultural heritage object. A few aspects are not 
    published because of various concerns such as copyright, confidentiality, 
    security and privacy. Other properties, like exhibition history or 
    provenance, might be added at a later date as capturing knowledge about 
    a cultural heritage is an ongoing effort.</p>

    <p><em>Q: How often are records updated?</em></p>

    <p>The records available in the Arthub Flanders catalog are updated on a 
    weekly basis. Updates include improvements of existing records, and the 
    addition of new records.</p>

    <p><em>Q: Why do I see duplicate records?</em></p>

    <p>Some organizations, like the Flemish Art Collection, do not manage a 
    collection of cultural heritage objects. As part of their core mission, 
    they mantain a copy of the records originally created by the cultural 
    heritage organisations they represent, in their own collection 
    registration systems. These duplicated records are then 'enriched' with 
    extra information such as translations, specific terminologies or content 
    suitable for particular audiences.</p>

    <p>These duplicate records are also available in the Arthub Flanders as 
    alternates to the record contributed by the cultural heritage organisation 
    which preserves the physical heritage object. You can derive the provenance 
    of a record via the 'Data PURL' and  'Work PURL' fields. The latter two 
    fields store persistent    URL's which unambiguously identify the record and 
    the cultural heritage object they describe. Records describing the same 
    cultural heritage object will have  differing Data PURL's but the same Work 
        PURL.</p>

    <p>The institution field is another indicator for the provenance of a 
    record, but does not indicate that the institution is the owner of the 
    cultural heritage object.</p>
