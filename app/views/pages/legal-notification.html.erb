	<h3>Inquiry regarding the attribution or authenticity</h3>

	<p>You can provide us with an inquiry regarding the authenticity of a work of art or an attribution of a work of art to a specific artist.</p>
	<p>The curators of the Flemish Art Collection, and its partner museums (the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, the Groeningemuseum in Bruges, the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, M - Museum Leuven and Mu.ZEE in Ostend) are able to provide an unofficial attribution or authenticity estimate. Estimations are also exclusively upon a visit by the owner of the work or authorised person, namely a legal representative.</p>
	<p>However, we cannot provide an appraisal of value due to ethical reasons. For a possible appraisal you can always contact a recognised appraiser or art dealer in your area (for Belgium: search the Yellow Pages under ‘purchase paintings’ or ‘art auctions’; and for Holland: <a href="http://www.federatie-tmv.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.federatie-tmv.nl/</a>).</p>
	<p>For an attribution or authenticity estimate you need to send a few photos of the work of art to us in the highest resolution possible. The photographs should show the work as an entirety, the possible signature of the artist, as well as the verso of the work. Once you have provided high-quality photos of the work of art, they will then be passed along to an expert curator.</p>
	<p>Possible information on the provenance of former owners can be of highly valuable information.</p>
	<p>The unofficial attribution or authenticity estimate is made by expert conservators of the partner museums to the best of their knowledge. Their verdict, however, is never definitive. Moreover, for a more conclusive judgment, the expertise of more experts is necessary. As such, we thus call the attribution or the authenticity estimate ‘unofficial’.</p>
	<p>No rights may be given upon the estimation or attribution. The appraisal or the attribution cannot be used for any commercial application. The information provided is protected by copyright and can only be made public and/or reproduced exclusively with the permission of the museum involved.</p>
	<p>As soon as one of our conservators has an attribution or authenticity estimate ready, we will provide you with this as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>Neither the Flemish Art Collection, nor the partner museums, nor the personnel of these organisations can be held responsible for an initial estimate or attribution that is found to be incorrect upon further inspection. The Flemish Art Collection likewise does not accept responsibility for previous damage or lost profit.</p>
