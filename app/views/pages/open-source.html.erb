	<h2>Open source tools</h2>

	<p>Arthub Flanders was designed and developed leveraging a set of open 
	source software libraries, frameworks and applications. 
	The <a href="http://www.flemishartcollection.be/" target="_blank">Flemish Art Collection</a>, 
	in close coöperation with <a href="http://www.packed.be" target="_blank">PACKED vzw</a>, 
	developed a set of tailor made tools which cater to the specific 
	requirements of this platform. The entire toolset is made available to the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry_sector)" target="_blank">GLAM</a> 
	community under an 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">open 
	source</a> license. Cultural organisations whose digital strategy outlines
	opening up their collections are invited to include and adapt these tools 
	in their own digital projects.<p>

	<h2>Technology</h2>

	<p>Arthub Flanders is a public discovery interface. It is the visible part
	of the platform and provides direct, user-friendly access to the collection
	metadata. The platform is constructed as an architecture of loose-coupled 
	components that automatically exchange, transform and make collection 
	metadata available via interfaces for humans or machines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API's</a>).</p>

	<h3>Project Blacklight</h3>

	<p>Blacklight is an open source Solr user interface discovery platform. You 
	can use Blacklight to enable searching and browsing of your collections. 
	Blacklight uses the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr 
	search engine</a> to search full text and/or metadata. Blacklight has a 
	highly configurable <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> 
	front end. Blacklight is made public under an Apache 2.0 license.<p>

	<p><a href="http://projectblacklight.org/" target="_blank">
	http://projectblacklight.org/</a></p>

	<p>Arthub Flanders is an instance of Project Blacklight tailored towards
	searching and browsing through cultural heritage objects. The code is made
	available through Github.</p>

	<h3>The Datahub</h3>

	<p>The Datahub is a web-based metadata aggregator. This applicaton 
	aggregates and stores collection metadata from one or more providers or 
	sources, and publishes the aggregated metadata via web-based API's.</p>

	<p>The Datahub implements two API types. The application features a 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST" target="_blank">REST API</a> which serves 
	metadata in the JSON format. Metadata is also made available via an 
	<a href="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/" target="_blank">OAI-PMH API</a>.</p>

	<p>The Datahub front end was build using the <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">
	Symfony Framework</a>. Aggregated metadata is persistently stored in a 
	<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> database.</p>

	<h3>Catmandu</h3>

	<p>Catmandu is a data processing toolkit that allows access and conversion
	of datasets from one format or datamodel into another.</p>

	<p>The Catmandu framework is Perl based and features an ecosystem of 
	pluggable modules which cater to a wide array of formats and use cases.</p>

	<p><a href="https://librecat.org" target="_blank">
	https://librecat.org</a></p>

	<h3>The Datahub Factory</h3>

	<p>The Datahub Factory is a tailor made command line tool which makes it
	easier to configure and monitor complex ETL (Extract Transform Load) 
	pipelines. This toolkit is Perl based and leverages Catmandu modules under 
	the hood.</p>

	<p>This command line tool is used to create ETL pipelines between collection 
	registration systems, the Datahub and Arthub Flanders. The Datahub Factory 
	is used to automatically transfer and transform collection metadata between 
	these systems.</p>

	<a name="formats"></a>
	<h2>Open formats</h2>

	<p>Collection metadata is automatically exchanged between the various
	systems which are operational in the platform. Before collection metadata
	is exchanged, it is transformed to a single unified format: LIDO XML</p>

	<p><a href="http://lido-schema.org" target="_blank">http://lido-schema.org</a></p>

	<p>LIDO is an XML harvesting schema. The schema is intended for delivering
	metadata, for use in a variety of online services, from an organization’s 
	online collections database to portals of aggregated resources, as well as 
	exposing, sharing and connecting data on the web.</p>

	<p>Metadata harvested from a collection registration system, is transformed 
	to LIDO XML by the Datahub Factory. The transformed metadata is then 
	aggregated by The Datahub. Records are transformed via scripts which are 
	written in Catmandu's <a href="http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#fix-language" target="_blank">
	Fix programming language</a>.</p>

	<p>A transformation script was created per institution. Each script defines 
	a mapping between record fields provided by the collection registration
	system and the fields of the LIDO datamodel. The scripts also contains logic
	that determines when values are to be taken over into the LIDO record.</p>

	<p>The scripts used by the Arthub Flanders platform are published on 
	Github.</p>
